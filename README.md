# Weather Predictor

Weather Predictor is a web application that provides weather forecasts by **comparing predictions from an external weather API with a trained machine learning model**.  
The project demonstrates how traditional API-based forecasting can be combined with ML-based predictions and stored for further analysis.

## Project Overview

The application allows users to select a city and a date to receive:
- A weather forecast retrieved from an external API (Open-Meteo)
- A prediction generated by a trained ML model

Both results are displayed to the user and saved in the database, allowing direct comparison between different forecasting approaches.

## Key Features

- City-based weather forecasting
- External weather API integration (Open-Meteo)
- Machine Learning model integration via REST API
- Comparison of API forecasts and ML predictions
- Forecast history stored in a database
- Simple and clear web interface
- Asynchronous service-based architecture

## How It Works

1. The user selects a city and a date.
2. The application retrieves real weather data from the Open-Meteo API.
3. The same data is sent as input to a trained ML model.
4. Results from both sources are displayed and saved.
5. Users can view past forecasts in the history section.

## Technologies Used

- ASP.NET MVC
- C#
- Entity Framework (Repository pattern)
- REST APIs
- Machine Learning model integration
- JSON serialization
- SQL database

## Purpose

This project was created to explore and compare different weather prediction approaches by combining real-world API data with machine learning models.  
It serves as a practical example of integrating ML services into a modern web application.
